This single plugin consolidates the syntax diagram processing from 
Deobrah Pickett's HTML+ plugins, which were previously tightly 
integrated to her two-pass HTML processing, and thus spread
across multiple plugins. This single plugin does not implement
HTML+ or the more general two-pass HTML approach; instead it
implements syntax diagrams as an add-on to preprocessing.
